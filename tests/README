Canto-curses Test Suite

REQUIRED:

*In addition to the usual c-c requirements*

xterm
bash
gzip
hexdump
diff
canto-remote
canto-daemon

UTF-8 encoding (set LC_ALL if you don't use one by default)

NOTES:

These are blackbox tests, which means you start the programs, you give a set
input and then you test that the output looks as expected. These are also
rife with off-the-cuff timings which seem generous (considering they're
usually spacing out keystrokes), but could cause the tests to fail on slower
hardware. This also means that these tests take a bit to run.

TILING WMS:

This test suite also relies on being able to set the geometry of the xterm.
This is overridden by tiling wms, so in order for the tests to pass, you have
to float the relevant xterms. They are all given the title `canto-test` (no
quotes) for this purpose.

RUN EXAMPLE:

./run.sh */
