- Lost keys when resizing
- Input state not persisting through resize.
- Unmatched groups in CommandHandlers obey no order, so depending on what order
  dict.keys() returns the prompts could have inconsistent ordering. We need
  to sort the keys by their position in the command string.


= FIXED =

X Ping sync doesn't work really. Perhaps need to ensure closing connection
  doesn't interrupt server completing its task.
        - Probably need a real SYNC command to close all open shelves.
X Cursor / other state not maintained through refresh
